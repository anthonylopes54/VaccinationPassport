## Inspiration
In the midst of COVID-19, we are coming across many new guidelines and safety precautions to help stop the spread of the virus. Some places across Canada are undergoing full lockdown procedures and are implementing curfews for their residents. In the hopes of quickly and safely moving towards a more normal lifestyle again, we need something that will keep track of people's vaccinations. In doing so, it can encourage people to get vaccinated and it can help to prevent large gatherings of unvaccinated individuals (i.e., only a certain number of unvaccinated individuals could be allowed in a given indoor space to greatly reduce the transmission rates).

## What it does
The vaccination passport we developed acts as a centralized, universally recognizable way to prove that you've been vaccinated. First, it asks for all your personal information. Upon getting your vaccination, you can tap a programmed NFC chip (ideally presented by a healthcare professional). Once tapped, your immunity passport will have your vaccination data on your phone (i.e., name, date of birth, date of vaccination, and type of vaccine). In addition, each NFC chip will be programmed with a specific password and the vaccination is only verified if the device can match the password presented by the NFC data. In doing this, users will only be able to obtain their vaccination status upon having the healthcare provider present the NFC chip to them (after validating their identity) and if the password provided by the NFC chip is valid.
